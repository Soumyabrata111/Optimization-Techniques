# Optimization Techniques

This repository contains implementations of various optimization techniques outlined in the book "Optimization of Engineering Design: Algorithms and Examples" by Prof. Kalyanmoy Deb. Each technique provides a visual representation by plotting both the function and the approximate minimum point (marked as 'o').

## Techniques Included

1. **Exhaustive Search Method**
   - Description: The exhaustive search method is a brute-force approach to finding the minimum of a function within a specified range.
   - Versions available for both Python and MATLAB:
      - [Python Code](exhaustive_search/ExhaustiveSearchMethod.py)
      - [MATLAB Code](exhaustive_search/ExhaustiveSearchMethod.m)

2. **Golden Section Search**
   - Description: The Golden Section Search is an iterative method that narrows down the search space to find the minimum of a unimodal function.
   - Versions available for both Python and MATLAB:
      - [Python Code](golden_section_search/GoldenSectionSearchMethod.py)
      - [MATLAB Code](golden_section_search/GoldenSectionSearchMethod.m)

3. **Bounding Phase Method**
   - Description: The Bounding Phase Method is an optimization technique that involves narrowing down the search interval to find the minimum of a unimodal function.
   - Versions available for both Python and MATLAB:
      - [Python Code](bounding_phase_search/BoundingPhaseMethod.py)
      - [MATLAB Code](bounding_phase_search/BoundingPhaseMethod.m)

4. **Interval Halving Method**
   - Description: The Interval Halving Method is an iterative approach for finding the minimum of a function within a specified interval.
   - Versions available for both Python and MATLAB:
      - [Python Code](interval_halving_search/IntervalHalvingMethod.py)
      - [MATLAB Code](interval_halving_search/IntervalHalvingMethod.m)

## About the Author

I am currently working as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Mandsaur University.
