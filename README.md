# Optimization Techniques

This repository contains implementations of various optimization techniques outlined in the book "Optimization of Engineering Design: Algorithms and Examples" by Prof. Kalyanmoy Deb.

## Techniques Included

1. **Exhaustive Search Method**
   - This program approximates the minimum of a user-defined function. It provides visual representation by plotting both the function and the minimum point (marked as 'o').

2. **Golden Section Search**
   - Updated versions available for both Python and MATLAB.

3. **Bounding Phase Method**
   - Updated versions available for both Python and MATLAB.

4. **Interval Halving Method**
   - Updated versions available for both Python and MATLAB.
