# Optimization-Techniques
There are many optimization algorithms described in the book "Optimization of Engineering Design: Algorithms and Examples" by Prof. Kalyanmoy Deb. I will try to write each of those algorithms in programming languages like MATLAB, Python etc. 
I am currently working as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Royal School of Engineering & Technology, Royal Global University, Guwahati-35, Assam, India.
