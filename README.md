# Optimization Techniques

This repository contains implementations of various optimization techniques outlined in the book "Optimization of Engineering Design: Algorithms and Examples" by Prof. Kalyanmoy Deb. The code provides visual representation by plotting both the function and the approximate minimum point (marked as 'o').

## Techniques Included
