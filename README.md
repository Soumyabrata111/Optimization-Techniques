# Optimization-Techniques
This repository will include many codes for optimisation techniques as described in the book "Optimization of Engineering Design: Algorithms and Examples" by Prof. Kalyanmoy Deb.

The first one in the lot is the exhaustive search method. The programme finds the approximate minimum of the function that the user inputs and plots both the function as well as the minimum point. The minimum point is represented by the (o) mark. The old code has been updated to replace the feval function, as that creates some security concerns. Now the code uses a function handle consisting of the expression that needs to be minimised.

Update:
1) Golden Section Search method for both python and matlab has been updated now.
2) Bounding Phase method for both python and matlab has been updated now.

I am currently working as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Mandsaur University.
