# Optimization Techniques

This repository contains implementations of various optimization techniques outlined in the book "Optimization of Engineering Design: Algorithms and Examples" by Prof. Kalyanmoy Deb. Each technique provides a visual representation by plotting both the function and the approximate minimum point (marked as 'o').

## Techniques Included

1. **Exhaustive Search Method**
   - Description: The exhaustive search method is a brute-force approach to finding the minimum of a function within a specified range.
   - Versions available for both Python and MATLAB:
      - [Python Code](https://github.com/Soumyabrata111/Optimization-Techniques/blob/master/ExhaustiveSearchMethod.py)
      - [MATLAB Code](https://github.com/Soumyabrata111/Optimization-Techniques/blob/master/ExhaustiveSearchMethod.m)

2. **Golden Section Search**
   - Description: The Golden Section Search is an iterative method that narrows down the search space to find the minimum of a unimodal function.
   - Versions available for both Python and MATLAB:
      - [Python Code](https://github.com/Soumyabrata111/Optimization-Techniques/blob/master/GoldenSectionSearchMethod.py)
      - [MATLAB Code](https://github.com/Soumyabrata111/Optimization-Techniques/blob/master/GoldenSectionSearchMethod.m)

3. **Bounding Phase Method**
   - Description: The Bounding Phase Method is an optimization technique that involves narrowing down the search interval to find the minimum of a unimodal function.
   - Versions available for both Python and MATLAB:
      - [Python Code](https://github.com/Soumyabrata111/Optimization-Techniques/blob/master/BoundingPhaseMethod.py)
      - [MATLAB Code](https://github.com/Soumyabrata111/Optimization-Techniques/blob/master/BoundingPhaseMethod.m)

4. **Interval Halving Method**
   - Description: The Interval Halving Method is an iterative approach for finding the minimum of a function within a specified interval.
   - Versions available for both Python and MATLAB:
      - [Python Code](https://github.com/Soumyabrata111/Optimization-Techniques/blob/master/IntervalHalvingMethod.py)
      - [MATLAB Code](https://github.com/Soumyabrata111/Optimization-Techniques/blob/master/IntervalHalvingMethod.m)
5. **Fibonacci Search Method**
   - Description: The Fibonacci Search Method is another iterative approach for finding the minimum of a function within a specified interval.
   - Version available for Python:
      - [Python Code](https://github.com/Soumyabrata111/Optimization-Techniques/blob/master/FibonacciSearchMethod.py)
      - [MATLAB Code](https://github.com/Soumyabrata111/Optimization-Techniques/blob/master/fibonacci_search_method.m)
6. **Quadratic Estimation Method**
   - Description: The Quadratic Estimation Method is the simplest of all the polynomial interpolation approach for finding the minimum of a function within a specified interval.
   - Version available for Python:
      - [Python Code](https://github.com/Soumyabrata111/Optimization-Techniques/blob/master/QuadraticEstimationMethod.py)
      - [MATLAB Code](https://github.com/Soumyabrata111/Optimization-Techniques/blob/master/QuadraticEstimationMethod.m)
7. **Quadratic Estimation Method**
   - Description: It is the more refined form of he Quadratic Estimation Method, which iteratively finds the minimum of a function within a specified interval.
   - Version available for Python:
      - [Python Code](https://github.com/Soumyabrata111/Optimization-Techniques/blob/master/SuccessiveQuadraticEstimationMethod.py)
