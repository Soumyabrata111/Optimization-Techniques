# Optimization-Techniques
There are many optimization algorithms described in the book "Optimization of Engineering Design: Algorithms and Examples" by Prof. Kalyanmoy Deb. I will try to write each of those algorithms in programming languages like MATLAB, Python etc. 
I am currently working as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Mandsaur University.
Please let me know if you find any bug. I can be reached at soumyabrata111@gmail.com
